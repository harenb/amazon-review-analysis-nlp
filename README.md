# Amazon Review Score Prediction

- Explored a dataset consisting of 100,000 Amazon.com review texts as well as the respective star ratings
- Constructed detailed visualizations to identify star rating trends over the course of different periods of the year
- Performed Latent Dirichlet Allocation modelling on the review texts in order to identify distinct topics in the reviews, after applying a tf-idf model to the data to discern keywords that defined the review topic
- Built a Bag of Words model which was applied to each of the review texts so as to obtain its vector representation, on which a classification model was then run to predict the star rating of each review, achieving an 87.6% accuracy
